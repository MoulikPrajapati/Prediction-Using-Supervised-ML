# Prediction-Using-Supervised-ML
Prediction of Linearly dependent variable is done using Machine Learning algorithm. 

The data set is about Score of student depending upon their hours of study. So, data set contains two variables such as Hours and Scores. From which Hours is independent and another one is dependent variable. 

It is a Supervised Machine Learning problem in which we are given some results from that have to predict the scores of student depending upon their study hours.

As the scores of student is continuous variable so it is a Regression problem and the relation is linear between hours of study and scores of student such that the Linear Regression Algorithm can be implemented on the data set to create model for predicton.
